### What?

Actually I'm asking myself this question for all the time I was doing this project, mostly of because there have been no clear and strict formulating not even of its purposes - but its actual meaning without "ummmm" and "hmmmm"

### Why?

1. It's complicated question in linquistics and in cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics especially, so applying new technologies could help to solve it...

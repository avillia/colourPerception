COLOUR PERCEPTION
=================

*or, actually*

Computer simulating of colour perception's evolution in linguistics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### What?

Actually I'm asking myself this question for all the time I was doing this project, mostly because there have been no 
clear and strict formulating not even of its purposes - but its actual meaning without all those cranky "ummmmm" and
"well, its kinda serious problem".

But back to the question.

As any single word in any language - whether it's spanish, sanskrit or mandarin - **the terms** *(in linguistics and
formal logic meaning)* **to describe colours evolved, as languages become more complex and developed.** 

### Why?

1. It's complicated question in linguistics and in cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics especially, so applying new technologies could help to solve it...

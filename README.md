*or, actually*

Computer simulating of color perception's evolution in linguistics.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### What?

I'm asking myself this question for all the time I was doing this project, mostly because there have been no 
clear and strict formulating not even of its purposes - but its actual meaning without all those cranky "ummmmm" and
"well, its kinda serious problem".

But back to the question.

As any single word in any language - whether it's Spanish, Sanskrit or Mandarin - **the terms** *(in linguistics and
formal logic definition)* **to describe colors evolved, as languages become more complex and developed.** 

### Why?

1. It's a complicated question in linguistics and cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics, that is a possible key to
prove the concept of Linguistics Relativity - *or eliminate it.*

2. As many natural processes, linguistics' ones could not be performed in an experimental way - the possibly 
ten-thousand-years-lasting unrepeatable due to obvious reasons, - so the only way to study them is by studying their models.

3. This is an interesting case of connecting fields of science that seems to be unrelated - linguistics,
biology, and data science.

4. And its ambitious, hilarious and complex project - why not to implement it?

### How?

* Dataset - generated *colourSet.csv* of different variables representing RGB.
* Clustering method - *AgglomerativeClustering* from *sklearn.cluster*
* Visualization - *tkinter* 

### Aim?

Reproduce the sequence of basic color acquiring by Berlin and Kay:
1. Dark-cool and light-warm *(this covers a larger set of colors than English "black" and "white".)*
2. Red
3. Either green or yellow
4. Both green and yellow
5. Blue
6. Brown
7. Purple, pink, orange, or gray

### Results?

*Kinda interesting...*
